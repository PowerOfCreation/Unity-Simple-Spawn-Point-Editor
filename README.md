# Instructions #

Clone this project and open it with Unity. Load the scene in the Assets/Scenes folder. 

Select the 'SpawnPoints' object in the hierarchy. 

- add new spawn points with a left click in the scene while holding control
- move spawn points by dragging them with the left mouse button
- delete spawn points with a right click on them

For actual spawning you have to write your own Code, this project is only for the selection of the spawn points!
